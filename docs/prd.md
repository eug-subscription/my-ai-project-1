# AI Food Photo Enhancer Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Goals and Background Context

### Goals

The primary goals for this project are:

* **Business Goals:**
    * Acquire 100 monthly active users within the first month of launch.
    * Grow to over 1,000 monthly active users within 12 months.
    * Achieve a positive 1:3 ratio for Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) to Lifetime Value (LTV).
    * Establish the product as a leading platform in its niche.
* **User Success Goals:**
    * Achieve a user satisfaction score above 4.5/5 for image quality.
    * See a photo completion (successful enhancement) rate of over 90%.
    * (Note: Technical performance goals such as processing speed and uptime will be detailed in the "Non-Functional Requirements" section.)

### Background Context

Food businesses consistently face a dilemma: professional photography is expensive (£500-£2000 per shoot) and time-consuming, while DIY smartphone photos or generic stock images often fail to look appealing, directly hurting online sales and brand perception. This problem is most acute for our target users: independent restaurant owners, cafe managers, and digital-first cloud kitchen operators, who lack the specific budget, time, and expertise required for traditional photography or complex editing software.

The AI Food Photo Enhancer solves this problem by offering a fast, affordable, and accessible SaaS platform. It leverages AI to recreate professional, marketing-ready images from simple smartphone photos in seconds. This empowers businesses to compete visually on crucial digital marketplaces like Uber Eats and Deliveroo, improve customer confidence, and ultimately increase sales.

## 2. Requirements

### Functional Requirements

* **FR1:** The system shall provide a public landing page featuring a "before and after" slider to demonstrate enhancement quality.
* **FR2:** The system shall allow a non-registered user to try the service with 3 free credits, using either their own images or one of 5 provided demo images.
* **FR3:** The system shall allow users to register for an account, log in, and manage a basic user profile.
* **FR4:** The system shall allow authenticated users to upload `JPG`, `PNG`, and `WEBP` image files up to 10MB in size.
* **FR5:** The system shall process an uploaded image using an AI engine to recreate it as a professional-quality photograph.
* **FR6:** The system shall provide an image gallery where users can view, manage, and download their original and enhanced photos.
* **FR7:** The system shall manage a user's credit balance, deducting the appropriate amount upon a successful image enhancement.
* **FR8:** The system shall allow users to purchase one-time credit packs and subscribe to monthly/annual plans using Stripe.
* **FR9:** The system shall include a mechanism for users to provide feedback on the quality of their enhanced images.

### Non-Functional Requirements

* **NFR1 (Performance):** 95% of image enhancements shall be completed in under 30 seconds.
* **NFR2 (Availability):** The system shall maintain a service uptime of greater than 99.9%.
* **NFR3 (Scalability):** For the MVP launch, the system must be built on a serverless architecture capable of rapid scaling. It should comfortably support 10-20 simultaneous users while being designed to handle future growth.
* **NFR4 (Security):** All user data and images must be encrypted both at rest and in transit. File downloads must use expiring signed URLs, and user authentication will be managed via JWTs.
* **NFR5 (Compliance):** The system must be designed to be GDPR compliant to support future expansion into European markets.
* **NFR6 (Usability):** The entire user interface must be fully responsive and optimised for a seamless experience on mobile devices.

## 3. User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

The user experience will be simple, intuitive, and professional, designed to be approachable for non-technical users while encouraging exploration. The interface must be clean and visually uncluttered, building user confidence by making the path from upload to enhanced image as fast and seamless as possible.

### Key User Flows

The UI must support three primary user flows:

1.  **First-Time User:** A frictionless trial experience from the landing page that guides the user to sign up after seeing the value.
2.  **Regular User:** An efficient dashboard-centric workflow for authenticated users to upload, manage, and download their images.
3.  **Bulk Processing:** A clear process for selecting and managing multiple image enhancements at once (post-MVP).

### Accessibility & Branding

* **Visual Style:** The UI will use a modern, clean, "glassmorphic" design with a dark mode primary, built upon the `HeroUI` component library and `Tailwind CSS`.
* **Accessibility:** The application will be WCAG compliant, leveraging the accessibility primitives built into the chosen component libraries.

## 4. Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo
* **Rationale:** A monorepo is suitable given the choice of `Next.js` to handle both the frontend application and the API layer, allowing for shared code and simplified dependency management.

### Service Architecture: Serverless
* **Rationale:** A serverless-first architecture, leveraging platforms like `Vercel` and `Supabase`, aligns with the project's goals for scalability, cost-effectiveness, and rapid development.

### Testing Requirements: Full Testing Pyramid
* **Rationale:** A comprehensive testing approach including unit, integration, and end-to-end (E2E) tests is required to ensure code quality and reliability.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
* **Primary Framework:** The application will be a full-stack `Next.js` application hosted on `Vercel`.
* **Database & BaaS:** `Supabase` will be used for the PostgreSQL database, user authentication, and file storage.
* **Workflow Automation:** The `n8n` workflow engine will orchestrate the AI processing pipeline.
* **Payment Integration:** All billing will be handled via the `Stripe` SDK.
