# AI Food Photo Enhancer UI/UX Specification

## 1. Overall UX Goals & Principles

### Target User Personas
Our design will cater to a range of users, with a primary focus on busy, non-technical food business operators who value speed and simplicity.

* **Primary Personas:** Restaurant Owners, Cafe/Bar Managers, and Cloud Kitchen Operators who need to create high-quality images quickly amidst hectic daily operations. Marketing Managers who require brand consistency and control across multiple venues.
* **Secondary Personas:** Individual Food Entrepreneurs (solopreneurs) with extreme time and budget constraints, and Delivery Platform Managers who need to improve image quality and compliance at scale.

### Usability Goals
* **Approachable:** The interface must be very approachable for non-technical users, with a clear focus on simplicity.
* **Efficient:** The workflow from uploading a photo to downloading the enhanced result must be fast, seamless, and require minimal clicks.
* **Confidence-Building:** Every step should build user confidence, from the clarity of the instructions to the quality of the final output. The experience should feel professional and reliable.

### Core Design Principles
* **Simplicity First:** We will prioritize a clean, minimal interface with generous white space to prevent any sense of clutter and keep the user focused on their task.
* **Clarity Over Cleverness:** The impact of every tool and feature will be made instantly clear, primarily through visual "before-and-after" previews. Navigation will be obvious and consistent.
* **Accessibility by Default:** The application will be designed to be accessible from the ground up, adhering to WCAG AA standards to ensure it is usable by everyone.

        * About Us
        * FAQ/Help
        * Contact/Support
    * Terms of Service
    * Privacy Policy
    * Status Page
* **Authenticated Pages**
    * Dashboard

        * Profile
        * Billing & Subscription
        * Transaction History
    * Support/Help Center

### Revised Navigation Structure
* **Unauthenticated (Public):**
    * **Header:** [Logo] [Pricing] [About] [Help] [Login] [Sign Up CTA]
    * **Footer:** Will contain columns for Product (Pricing, FAQ, Status), Company (About, Contact), and Legal (Terms, Privacy, Refunds).
* **Authenticated (Private):**
    * **Top Navigation Bar:** [Logo] [Dashboard] [Account] [Help] [Credits: 24] [Avatar ▼] (with dropdown for Profile, Billing, Logout).
    * **Mobile Navigation:** A hamburger menu (☰) will reveal the primary navigation links for authenticated users.

## 3. User Flows

### Flow: First-Time Trial User Journey
* **User Goal:** To experience the "magic moment" of the AI enhancement on their own photo with zero commitment, and be compelled to register to save their result.
* **Key Policy:** This flow strictly enforces the no-download policy for trial users to create a strong incentive to register. Results are viewable but not saveable.
* **Emotional Journey Map:** 1. Curiosity (Landing) -> 2. Skepticism (Upload) -> 3. Anticipation (Processing) -> 4. Delight (Result) -> 5. Desire (Conversion).

### Flow: New User Onboarding Journey
* **User Goal:** To seamlessly transition from registration into the authenticated dashboard, understand their account status, and be guided toward their next valuable action.
* **Core Principles:** This flow uses progressive disclosure and contextual tooltips instead of a disruptive upfront tour.
* **Credit Allocation:** Unused trial credits are transferred to their new account; direct registrations receive 5 starter credits.

### Flow: Error Recovery Flows
* **Guiding Principles:** Prevention first, clear communication, and graceful recovery.
* **Sub-Flows Defined For:** Image Upload Failure, AI Enhancement Failure, Trial Image Transfer Failure, Payment Failure, and Feedback/Recovery System Failures.

## 4. Wireframes & Mockups

### Design Tool
`Figma` is the chosen tool for this project due to its collaborative features, strong component system, and excellent developer handoff capabilities.

### Wireframe Delivery Approach
For the MVP, we will focus on creating **Low-Fidelity Wireframes**. This approach prioritizes structural layout and functionality over detailed visual design, allowing for faster iteration. Mobile-first wireframes will be created for all key screens.

### Key Screen Layouts (Tier 1 Priority)
* Homepage / Landing Page: Hero section with trial CTA, Before/After gallery, How It Works, Pricing Preview, Testimonials, FAQ.
* Dashboard: Quick actions (Upload CTA), Credit Balance display, Recent Images gallery.
* Upload/Enhancement Flow: File upload area, demo image selection, engaging processing status messages.
* Image Detail View: Large before/after slider, download button (for registered users), rating component.
* Pricing Page: Clear pricing tiers, feature comparisons, social proof, prominent CTAs.

## 5. Component Library / Design System

### Design System Approach
The project will be built upon `HeroUI` & `HeroUI Pro`, leveraging its production-grade, accessible components. Custom components will only be created when necessary and will be styled with `Tailwind CSS`, adhering to a consistent set of design tokens.

### Core Components List (Prioritized)
* **Tier 1:** Navigation Header, Image Uploader, Before/After Slider, Image Gallery Card, Credit Balance Display.
* **Tier 2:** Pricing Tier Card, Rating Component, Modal/Dialog System, Status Notification/Toast, Loading States.

### Component Library Governance
All components will follow a consistent naming convention and file structure. New components will require design review, code review, and must pass accessibility (`WCAG AA`) and performance audits before being merged.

## 6. Branding & Style Guide

### Brand Personality
The brand should be perceived as: **Professional, Approachable, Efficient, and Premium.**

### Visual Identity & Design System Integration
The visual identity is a modern glassmorphic design with a dark mode primary focus. The entire system will align with the design tokens and principles of the `HeroUI` library and `Tailwind CSS`.

### Colour Palette
* **Primary (Brand):** Deep Blue (`#1e40af`), Warm Orange (`#f97316`)
* **Semantic:** Standardised colours for Success (`#22c55e`), Warning (`#f59e0b`), and Error (`#ef4444`).
* **Neutral:** A scale of cool greys (e.g., `#64748b`) for backgrounds and text.

### Typography
* **Primary Font Family:** `Inter`. Chosen for its excellent screen readability and professional appearance.

## 7. Animation & Micro-interactions

### Technical Integration: Motion.dev
All animations will be implemented using the `Motion.dev` library to ensure hardware-accelerated, performant animations that are integrated with the `HeroUI` component architecture.

### Emotional Motion Guidelines
Motion design will be **confident, efficient, premium, and approachable** to reinforce the brand personality.

### Core Animation Categories
* Glassmorphic Surface Animations (blur, transparency)
* Product Interaction Animations (upload, slider, processing)
* Navigation & Layout Animations (transitions, modals)
* Feedback & Status Animations (loading, success, error)
* Mobile Gesture Animations (swipe, touch)

## 8. Performance Considerations

### Performance Goals
* **Core Web Vitals:** The application will target "Good" scores for `LCP` (<2.5s), `FID` (<100ms), and `CLS` (<0.1) on mobile devices.
* **AI Processing:** The core enhancement process must complete in under 30 seconds for 95% of images.
* **PWA Performance:** Critical resources will be cached to achieve <1s offline load times on repeat visits.

### Performance Budget
A strict performance budget will be enforced, including a target for the initial JS Bundle of `<150KB` gzipped.
