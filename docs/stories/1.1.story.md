## Testing

### Testing Standards
**Source: [architecture.md#tech-stack]**

- **Framework**: Vitest 3.2.4 with Snapshots v2, performance improvements
- **Test Location**: Tests should be co-located with components in `__tests__` directories or `.test.ts` files
- **Coverage**: Unit tests for utility functions, integration tests for API endpoints
- **Standards**: Follow testing pyramid approach with unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
- **Configuration**: Use shared test configuration from packages/tsconfig

### Testing Requirements for This Story
- Unit tests for environment configuration validation
- Integration tests for Supabase connection
- Build pipeline verification tests
- Deployment smoke tests

## Rollback Procedures

### Development Rollback Steps
**If issues occur during development:**

1. **Dependency Issues:**
   - Rollback to previous package.json states: `git checkout HEAD~1 package.json apps/web/package.json`
   - Clear node_modules and reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules && pnpm install`
   - Reset lockfile if corrupted: `rm pnpm-lock.yaml && pnpm install`

2. **Configuration Issues:**
   - Restore working configurations: `git checkout HEAD~1 -- turbo.json next.config.js`
   - Reset environment variables to defaults: Copy from `.env.example`
   - Revert TypeScript configs: `git checkout HEAD~1 -- packages/tsconfig/`

3. **Build Pipeline Issues:**
   - Rollback Turborepo config: `git checkout HEAD~1 -- turbo.json`
   - Reset to basic Next.js build: Remove custom webpack config from `next.config.js`
   - Disable problematic optimizations: Comment out Turbopack usage

4. **Integration Rollback:**
   - Disconnect Supabase: Remove client initialization, comment out usage
   - Revert to mock implementations: Replace real clients with test doubles
   - Disable external services: Add feature flags to environment config

### Emergency Deployment Rollback
**If production deployment fails:**

1. **Vercel Platform Rollback:**
   - Use Vercel dashboard to rollback to previous deployment
   - Alternative: `vercel --prod --rollback`

2. **Git-based Rollback:**
   - Create rollback branch: `git checkout -b rollback-foundation`
   - Reset to working commit: `git reset --hard <last-working-commit>`
   - Force deploy: `git push origin rollback-foundation --force`

3. **Environment Recovery:**
   - Verify environment variables in Vercel dashboard
   - Test database connectivity from Vercel functions
   - Confirm all external service configurations

### Rollback Success Criteria
- Application builds without errors
- All tests pass
- Development server starts successfully  
- Production deployment completes
- Health checks return 200 status
