# Project Brief: AI Food Photo Enhancer

## 1. Executive Summary

The AI Food Photo Enhancer is a SaaS platform designed to solve a critical problem for food businesses: the need for high-quality, professional menu photography without the associated high costs and time investment. By leveraging advanced AI, the platform recreates dishes from ordinary smartphone photos into appetising, marketing-ready images in under 30 seconds. This empowers restaurant owners, cafe managers, and cloud kitchen operators to elevate their brand perception and increase online sales by creating consistent, professional visuals across all their platforms. The core value is providing an accessible, fast, and cost-effective alternative to traditional food photography and complex editing tools.

## 2. Problem Statement

### Current State & Pain Points
Food businesses, from restaurants to cloud kitchens, struggle to produce high-quality, professional images for their menus and marketing materials. They often have to rely on their own smartphone photos or stock image websites, resulting in visuals that are poorly lit, badly composed, or overly generic.

### Impact of the Problem
This reliance on low-quality or generic stock photos directly harms sales and damages brand perception in a highly competitive market.

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short
The primary alternatives are prohibitively expensive and time-consuming. A professional food photography shoot can cost between £500-£2000, and complex photo editing tools require specialised expertise that business owners and managers do not have.

### Urgency
In a digital-first economy where customers make decisions based on what they see online, professional-looking photos are no longer a luxury but a necessity for driving sales and building a strong brand.

## 3. Proposed Solution

### Core Concept and Approach
The AI Food Photo Enhancer is a SaaS platform that uses advanced AI processing to recreate professional, marketing-ready images from ordinary smartphone photos. Rather than simply applying a filter, the service fundamentally improves the core photographic elements—composition, lighting, and background—to produce a polished and consistent look. This approach frees users from the complications of organising professional photoshoots (saving time, money, and reducing food waste), the need to learn advanced photo editing tools, and the poor results from badly composed or poorly lit smartphone photos. It also provides a superior alternative to using generic stock photos that do not accurately represent a business's actual dishes.

### Key Differentiators
The solution's unique advantages are its speed (under 30-second processing), low cost (pennies per image compared to hundreds for a photoshoot), accessibility (no technical skills required), and its ability to produce a uniform style across all images, ensuring brand consistency.

### Why This Solution Will Succeed
It targets the majority of food businesses who are underserved by existing solutions. It provides a specialised, "all-in-one" platform that is faster, cheaper, and more effective than traditional methods or basic photo editors, which cannot fix fundamental issues in a photo.

### High-Level Vision
The vision is to become the "Canva for food photography," democratising professional-quality food imagery and making it accessible to any food business, regardless of size or budget.

## 4. Target Users

### Primary User Segment: Restaurant Owner
* **Typical Workflow & Behaviours:** Works long hours, wearing multiple hats from operations and supplier management to customer service and kitchen support. Spends a significant portion of the day "firefighting" unexpected issues. Administrative tasks, including marketing, are often squeezed into small gaps in a hectic schedule.
* **Pain Points:** Lacks the time, skills, and budget for professional photoshoots; struggles to meet the high-quality image guidelines of delivery platforms; finds the logistics of professional photography a major headache.

6.  **User Interface & Experience:** A central dashboard and a fully mobile-optimised experience.
7.  **Quality Assurance & Feedback:** A mechanism for users to provide feedback on enhancement quality.

### Out of Scope for MVP
* **All B2B/Team Features:** Team Admin, Team Manager, and Vendor roles are deferred to a later phase.

* Advanced Analytics & Reporting: Give users insights into image performance.

### Long-term Vision
The long-term vision is to establish the platform as the "Canva for food photography," becoming the recognised market leader.

## 8. Technical Considerations

### Technology Preferences
The stack is confirmed as `Next.js` (Frontend/API) with `HeroUI`, `n8n` (Automation), `Supabase` (PostgreSQL DB, Auth, Storage), `Stripe` (Payments), and a primary/fallback AI provider strategy (`OpenAI`/`fal.ai`).

### Architecture Considerations
The architecture is serverless-first, likely in a monorepo structure. Key security requirements like data encryption, `JWTs`, signed URLs, and `GDPR` compliance are mandatory.

## 9. Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints
* **Technical:** 10MB file size limit, `JPG`/`PNG`/`WEBP` formats, 60s processing timeout, 5-image MVP batch limit.
* **Business:** Freemium credit allocation must be carefully balanced, AI processing costs must remain <30% of revenue, and `GDPR` is required for EU expansion.

### Key Assumptions
* **Pricing & Quality:** Assumes users will pay £0.50-£2.00 per image for a quality they rate >4.2/5.
* **Usage & Conversion:** Assumes active users will process 10+ photos/month and that B2B features will drive high-value conversions post-MVP.

## 10. Risks & Open Questions

### Key Risks
* **Technical Risk:** AI quality may be inconsistent. Mitigation: User feedback loops and a multi-provider fallback system.
* **Business Risk:** AI API costs could increase. Mitigation: Cost monitoring, provider diversification, and negotiating volume discounts.
* **Market Risk:** Competitors could emerge. Mitigation: Focus on the food niche and build a defensible moat with B2B features and integrations.
* **Adoption Risk:** Free-to-paid conversion rates may be lower than projected. Mitigation: A/B test the trial offer and gather feedback from non-converting users.

### Open Questions
* What is the go-to-market strategy for acquiring the first 100 users?
* What is the policy for refunding credits for unsatisfactory results?
